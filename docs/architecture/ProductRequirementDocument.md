# Product Requirement Document (PRD): DataReady AI

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
DataReady AI is a software tool designed to evaluate the AI readiness of datasets (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) by assessing key criteria such as data quality, accessibility, governance, AI compatibility, and diversity. It generates a comprehensive readiness score and provides actionable recommendations to improve dataset suitability for AI and machine learning (ML) workflows.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Data scientists and ML engineers preparing datasets for AI projects.
- Data engineers and analysts responsible for data quality and governance.
- Enterprises and organizations evaluating datasets for AI adoption.
- Compliance officers ensuring datasets meet regulatory and ethical standards.

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to determine whether their datasets are suitable for AI applications due to issues like missing data, inconsistencies, bias, or compliance risks. Manual assessments are time-consuming and error-prone, and there is no standardized tool to automate AI readiness evaluation across diverse dataset types.

### 1.4 Solution
DataReady AI will automate the assessment of datasets using a standardized framework, providing:
- A numerical AI readiness score (0–100) based on weighted criteria.
- Detailed reports highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.
- Support for structured (e.g., CSV, SQL), semi-structured (e.g., JSON, XML), and unstructured (e.g., text, images, audio) data.
- Integration with common data storage platforms and AI/ML pipelines.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Dataset Ingestion
- **Description**: Import datasets in various formats and from multiple sources.
- **Supported Formats**:
  - Structured: CSV, Excel, SQL databases.
  - Semi-structured: JSON, XML, YAML.
  - Unstructured: Text (TXT, PDF), images (JPEG, PNG), audio (WAV, MP3).
- **Sources**: Local files, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), APIs.
- **Requirements**:
  - Support file uploads and API-based data ingestion.
  - Handle datasets up to 10 GB initially (scalable in future versions).
  - Validate file integrity and format compatibility during ingestion.

### 2.2 Automated Assessment
- **Description**: Evaluate datasets across five categories: Data Quality, Accessibility, Governance, AI Compatibility, and Diversity/Bias.
- **Criteria and Metrics** (based on the framework):
  - **Data Quality**:
    - Completeness: Percentage of missing/null values or incomplete records.
    - Accuracy: Error rate via sampling or comparison to ground truth (if provided).
    - Consistency: Schema/format uniformity (e.g., date formats, JSON structure).
    - Timeliness: Data age relative to use case requirements.
  - Accessibility:
    - Availability: Ease of access (e.g., direct, preprocessing needed).
    - Volume: Sufficiency for AI task (e.g., >10,000 samples for NLP).
  - Governance:
    - Privacy: Detection of PII or sensitive content.
    - Licensing: Verification of usage rights (manual input or metadata check).
  - AI Compatibility:
    - Relevance: Alignment with user-defined AI task (e.g., classification, NLP).
    - Labeling: Quality and consistency of annotations (if applicable).
    - Feature Richness: Variability and informativeness of features.
    - Preprocessing Needs: Estimated effort for cleaning or transformation.
  - Diversity/Bias:
    - Representativeness: Coverage of target population or use case.
    - Diversity: Variety across key dimensions (e.g., demographics, topics).
- **Requirements**:
  - Automated checks for completeness, consistency, and volume using libraries (e.g., pandas, NLTK, OpenCV).
  - PII detection using regex or NLP-based tools (e.g., spaCy, Presidio).
  - Bias detection using statistical analysis or fairness libraries (e.g., Fairlearn).
  - User input for context (e.g., AI task type, timeliness requirements).
  - Modular assessment pipeline to support new criteria in future updates.

### 2.3 Scoring System
- **Description**: Generate a composite AI readiness score (0–100) based on weighted criteria.
- **Weighting**:
  - Data Quality: 40% (Completeness 10%, Accuracy 10%, Consistency 10%, Timeliness 10%).
  - Accessibility: 20% (Availability 10%, Volume 10%).
  - Governance: 15% (Privacy 10%, Licensing 5%).
  - AI Compatibility: 20% (Relevance 5%, Labeling 5%, Feature Richness 5%, Preprocessing 5%).
  - Diversity/Bias: 5% (Representativeness 2.5%, Diversity 2.5%).
- **Scoring Logic**:
  - Each criterion scored on a 0–4 scale (0 = poor, 2 = moderate, 4 = excellent).
  - Weighted scores summed to produce final score.
  - Example: Completeness (4 points, 10% weight) contributes 4 × 0.1 = 0.4 to total.
- **Requirements**:
  - Allow users to customize weights via UI.
  - Provide score breakdown by category and criterion.
  - Map scores to readiness levels: High (80–100), Moderate (60–79), Low (40–59), Not Ready (<40).

  - Breakdown of scores by category and criterion.
  - Visualizations (e.g., bar charts, radar charts) for score distribution.
  - Specific issues (e.g., “30% missing values in column X”, “Potential PII detected”).
  - Actionable recommendations (e.g., “Impute missing values using median”, “Add annotations for 500 unlabeled images”).
- **Requirements**:
  - Export reports as PDF, HTML, or JSON.
  - Include interactive charts for score visualization (using Chart.js).
  - Provide prioritized recommendations based on impact (e.g., fixing completeness vs. minor consistency issues).
