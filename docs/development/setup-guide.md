# DataAptor AI Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup and implementation of the DataAptor AI MVP. It covers all the necessary steps to get started with development, from environment setup to implementing the core services.

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the DataAptor AI platform, follow these steps in order:

1. [Set up the development environment](./environment-setup-guide.md)
2. [Implement the core services](./mvp-implementation-guide.md)

## Directory Structure

The DataAptor AI project follows a microservices architecture with the following structure:

```
data-aptor-ai/
├── client/                 # Frontend web application
├── services/               # Backend microservices
│   ├── api-gateway/        # API Gateway service
│   ├── auth-service/       # Authentication service
│   ├── ingestion-service/  # Data ingestion service
│   ├── assessment-service/ # AI readiness assessment service
│   ├── scoring-service/    # Scoring service
│   └── reporting-service/  # Reporting service
├── scripts/                # Utility scripts
├── docs/                   # Documentation
└── deployment/             # Deployment configurations
```

## Implementation Workflow

For efficient development of the DataAptor AI platform, follow this recommended workflow:

1. **Set up the development environment**
   - Configure Docker and Docker Compose
   - Set up the PostgreSQL database
   - Configure MinIO for object storage

2. **Implement the core services**
   - Start with the Ingestion Service
   - Implement the Assessment Service
   - Develop the Scoring Service
   - Create the Reporting Service
   - Build the API Gateway

3. **Develop the frontend**
   - Implement the web interface
   - Connect to the backend services
   - Build the dashboard and visualizations

4. **Test and refine**
   - Perform unit and integration testing
   - Validate the end-to-end workflow
   - Optimize performance and fix issues

## Development Approach

Use the following approach for developing each service:

1. **Define the API contract**
   - Document the endpoints
   - Specify request/response formats
   - Define error handling

2. **Implement the core functionality**
   - Create the database models
   - Implement the business logic
   - Connect to dependent services

3. **Add validation and error handling**
   - Validate input data
   - Handle edge cases
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Test the service**
   - Write unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Validate against requirements

## Next Steps

After reviewing this guide, proceed to the [Environment Setup Guide](./environment-setup-guide.md) to begin setting up your development environment.

For detailed information on implementing the services, refer to the [MVP Implementation Guide](./mvp-implementation-guide.md).
